## ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to Crawlify

Crawlify is the web crawling platform built for AI-native products. With a
single API layer you can fetch a specific URL, stream an entire site map, or
aggregate search results, always returning clean Markdown, structured JSON,
screenshots, and rich metadata that downstream LLMs can understand immediately.

### Why developers choose Crawlify
- **LLM-ready output** â€“ Normalize any page into Markdown, JSON, HTML,
screenshots, and semantic metadata with one request.
- **Full-site crawling** â€“ Recursively discover accessible pages, respect
robots.txt, deduplicate near-duplicates, and stream results in real time.
- **Search aggregation** â€“ Fan out to multiple search providers, filter noise,
and surface the most relevant candidates with summaries.
- **Developer console** â€“ Manage tasks, queues, billing, and auth through a
Laravel + Inertia + React control panel.

### What you can build
- Retrieval-augmented generation pipelines that stay fresh with live web
context.
- Automated competitor or documentation monitoring systems.
- Knowledge bases that ingest multi-format snapshots of entire domains.
- Search agents that go beyond a single provider and rank the combined signal.

### Getting started
1. Create an account at [crawlify.io](https://crawlify.io) to claim your free
1,000-credit quota.
2. Call the REST API with your preferred languageâ€”SDKs and Postman collections
are available in the docs.
3. Use the dashboard or API to track crawl jobs, inspect responses, and manage billing.
